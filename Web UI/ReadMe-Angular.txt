Read Me File For Angular 

1. In order to run angular code on the machine we need to install npm , node and angular cli latest versions.
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
npm -v or npm –version
npm install -g @angular/cli
2. Angular have node modules installed in it which have a very heavy size. So in order to install node modules, go inside code folder and run “npm install”, it will by default install the packages in package.json file.

3. Make sure backend is also running on your server, once all this is setup.

4. Go to the code folder , in this case “twitterEngine” and run ng serve, it will host the code on http://localhost:4200/ and than you can access the search engine.
